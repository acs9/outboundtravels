LTD from New Delhi as our tour operator in India for our private tour there in Feb. 2014. It turned out to be an excellent choice! We communicated directly with Mr. Prateek Chawla (prateek@outboundtravels.com). He helped us design the route and then took care of all reservations of hotels, cars with drivers, local guides and train tickets (we only handled air tickets on our own). We had a very extensive plan covering 10 destinations in 15 days. The trip was incredible, and good part of that should be attributed to Prateek's travel arrangements which worked without a hitch. We highly recommend his services!

</p><p>I just got back from my trip and wanted to thank you for all of the arrangements that you made on my behalf.
</p><p>The drive around Rajasthan was great, the driver was excellent, cautious and safe. The guides that you arranged for me in the principle cities were also great, knowledgeable but not intrusive. The car was just right, comfortable and a good size (especially for me at 6' 4" tall).
</p><p>All in all, everything worked seamlessly.
</p><p>As for my selected schedule, I think the overall time allocated for the trip was just right, however I would probably reduce the stay in Jaipur by one day and add it to Jaisalmer.
